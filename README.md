- Health: value + 2d20
- Defence: value + 1d20
- Attack: value + 1d20
- Retaliation: value + 1d8

## Storm Attacks

Each warrior has 3 special Storm Attacks they can perform that not only do damage, but also cause other critical damage.
These include
- Temporarily reducing opponents Defence value
- Allowing Retaliation on failing attacks
- Increased Attack value
- Increased Defence value
- Reducing damage taken.

Storm attacks require element charge before they can be executed.

Each Storm Attack applies for __3 turns__.

## Weather Affects

By playing a Weather card, any Warriors in play that are from that Storm type (including opponent Warriors), gain increased
damage values.

If an attack is successful, roll an additional __1d8__ to determine the extra damage (on top of the __1d20__ for normal damage)

A Storm lasts for __5 turns__ unless an Player plays another Weather card which cancels the one in play and immediately applies the new one.
An opponent cannot play a weather card until their turn.

## Item Cards

Warriors can carry up to __2__ items.  Each item will increase the base stats of the Warrior all the time they are carrying them.
Items can be removed to place better items but the card must be discarded from your deck.

## Game Mechanics

The gameInstance is designed for two players.

Each player takes __3 Warrior__ Cards and places them face up on the board.

The __Game pack__ is shuffled and placed face down.

Roll __1d8__.  The player with the lowest number goes first choosing a Warrior to battle.

**For Each Turn**

Player starts by picking __2 cards__ from the __Play Card Deck__. The cards can be saved or applied immediately to the gameInstance.
You may play from 0 to 2 cards per turn.
To attack, roll a __1d20__ and add it to the Warriors Attack value.
The defending player then rolls __1d20__ defence value and adds it to their Warrior's Defence value.
If the attack value is equal, nothing happens and no retaliation can be performed; this ends the turn.
If the attack is higher, then the Attack was a success otherwise the Attack failed.
If the attack was successful, player rolls a __1d20__ to determine the attack __Damage__. This is deducted from the opponents health.
If the attack failed, the defending player then has a chance to retaliate. Opponent performs the same process  as an attack but the __1d20__ value is added to the retaliate score instead.
If the retaliation was a success, roll a __1d8__ to determine the retaliation __Damage__ and remove it from the attacking players health, otherwise the turn is over.
Element cards for a Special Attack are discarded after the turn even if the attack failed.

Once a Warriors health reaches 0 or below, the Warriors is removed from the battle and another, if available, can join in their place.
